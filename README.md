This is the frontend of the ScriptSearch application, the backend of which can be found [here](https://github.com/Script-Search/backend). The capabilities of the website are currently reduced in the interest of cost efficiency, but here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeOV_euLox4) showcasing our application. For our User Manual and more detailed info, see our [Wiki](https://github.com/Script-Search/frontend/wiki).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
